## Introduction
This mod allows the users of the Personal Messaging (PM) system to search sent PMs in addition to the core Inbox PMs.  With the [Search Sent Personal Messages (PMs)](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3888) mod installed, you also get the ability to choose between read and unread outgoing PMs.

**Version 2.0** introduces the concept of taking action on searched-for PMs.  (Not available on the Core theme!)

## Admin Settings
There are no admin settings.  To disable it, you must remove this mod.
